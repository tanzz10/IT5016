The Program Principals from the Code.

KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
Analysis: The code is structured in a straightforward manner. Each class has a clear purpose: Movie handles movie attributes, Customer manages customer interactions, and RentalStore organizes the rental process. Methods are named descriptively, making it easy to understand their functionality without excessive complexity.

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Analysis: The code adheres to the DRY principle by avoiding code duplication. For instance, the rent_movie and return_movie methods in the Customer class encapsulate all logic related to renting and returning movies without repeating similar logic in multiple places.

Open/Closed Principle
Analysis: The code is not entirely open/closed since the RentalStore class directly manages its collection of movies. If you want to change how movies are handled (like adding a new feature), you might need to modify the existing class. A better approach would be to abstract movie handling into a separate class or use an interface.

Composition > Inheritance
Analysis: The code uses composition effectively. Instead of creating subclasses of Customer or Movie, it creates instances of these classes. This approach allows for greater flexibility and easier maintenance, as the behavior of these classes can be modified independently without affecting each other

Single Responsibility Principle
Analysis: Each class has a single responsibility. Movie is responsible for movie details and availability, Customer handles customer-related actions (like renting and returning), and RentalStore manages the collection of movies and their availability. This clarity improves maintainability and readability.

Separation of Concerns
Analysis: The separation of concerns is evident in the structure. Each class is focused on its own responsibilities, and the main application logic resides in the main() function. This organization prevents different parts of the code from interfering with one another, enhancing clarity.

Refactor, Refactor, Refactor
Analysis: While the code is relatively clean, thereâ€™s always room for refactoring. For example, the movie search functionality could be encapsulated within the RentalStore to improve separation and maintainability. Regular refactoring will help adapt the code as new features are added.

Clean Code > Clever Code
Analysis: The code emphasizes clean code principles by using clear naming conventions and straightforward logic. Instead of implementing clever shortcuts or complex structures, it opts for readability and maintainability, making it easier for future developers (or the original developer) to understand and modify.
